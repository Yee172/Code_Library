# Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_{j} and P_{k},
# for which their sum and difference are pentagonal
# and D = |P_{k} âˆ’ P_{j}| is minimised.
# What is the value of D?
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Analysis: brute force
#           Assume P[j] + P[k] = P[l]
#              and P[j] - P[k] = P[i]
#           Then,  2 * P[j] = P[l] + P[i]
#              and 2 * P[k] = P[l] - P[i]
#           We want to find the minimised P[i],
#           so enumerate P[i] and P[l] to get the answer.
