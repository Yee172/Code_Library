# A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit.
# We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k.
# Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1,
# it can be shown that there always exists a value, k,
# for which R(k) is divisible by n, and let A(n) be the
# least such value of k.
# You are given that for all primes, p > 5, that p âˆ’ 1
# is divisible by A(p).
# However, there are rare composite values for which
# this is also true.
# Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of
# n for which GCD(n, 10) = 1 and n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(n).
